# HirePilot Frontend

This is a simple Svelte frontend for HirePilot with one page and two components:

- `JobInput.svelte`: Input job details (title, company, link)
- `JobList.svelte`: List all entered jobs

## Usage

1. Start the Svelte dev server (e.g., `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`)
2. Use the form to add jobs
3. See the list update below the form

The main page is `App.svelte` which brings both components together.
